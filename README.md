Elixir implementation of the Bolt protocol and corresponding PackStream
protocol. Both is being used by Neo4J.

*Warning: This is currently WIP and only in the wild to gather feedback!*

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add boltex to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:boltex, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure boltex is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:boltex]]
        end

## Try it out!

```elixir
Boltex.test 'localhost', 7687, "MATCH (n) RETURN n"
```
